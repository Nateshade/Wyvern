   <h2>Wyvern is under construction!</h2>
   <p>The intent of this page is to be a hub for news on Crypto, Cybersecurity, Open Source software/hardware, and new technologies.</p>
   <p>When this page is complete, it will likely be curated by Nateshade or N-O-D-E for optimal freedom.</p>
   <p>The main philosophy of Wyvern is "Don't Be Evil." "Being Evil", in this context, is being indifferent or outright hostile towards other life, especially intelligent life.</p>
   <p>Life may not be sacred to the universe, but to living things it is.</p>
   <p>But this isn't an Ethics class. This is Wyvern. So be excellent to each other</p>
   <p>If you want to donate, links will be up soon, but I want to get N-O-D-E's donation info onto the site first, so as not to seem like I'm stealing funds.</p>
   <p>Thanks!</p>
